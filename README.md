# javascript-automatic-tab-module
creates tabs with few lines of code<br />
need to add the class "tabsModule" for the container<br />
and the class "tabsControl" for the tabs themself<br />
and finally add the class "theContent" for the show and hide content<br />
<br />
the javascript runs without any global varibles and comparing the tabs element with the content to show element by the order<br />
of the elements in the DOM<br />
it adds an "active" class when new tab is click<br />
no need for any other id or class just keep the order of the tabs and content you want to show the same
